## Project

* Developed a robust web application utilizing NodeJS and ExpressJS for the backend, and integrating RDS for the database, S3 for file storage, and SES for email notifications
* Orchestrated a fault-tolerant application by deploying instances across multiple availability zones, implementing auto-scaling policies and load-balancing techniques
*	Established an efficient CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, containerization through HashiCorp Packer, and IaaC setup using CloudFormation
* Utilized various AWS services, including IAM, VPC, EC2, Route53, RDS, S3, CloudWatch, ELB, ASG, SNS, SES, and KMS, to optimize application performance and security
* Implemented industry best practices, such as restricted access to the RDS instance to the application, restricted access to the application to the load balancer
